# Cryptographic-AutoEncoder
A privacy-preserving autoencoder framework that introduces cryptographic-style latent variations to enhance data security during representation learning. Built for secure and robust reconstruction using deep learning.


# 🔐 Cryptographic Autoencoder with Latent Variations

This project proposes a novel autoencoder architecture inspired by cryptographic techniques to preserve data privacy during feature encoding. The encoder introduces controlled **latent variations**, making the latent space resistant to direct inversion, while the decoder remains capable of robust reconstruction. This design has applications in **federated learning**, **private data transmission**, and **secure representation learning**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧬 **Latent Variation Encoding**:  
  Introduces perturbations or transformations in the latent vector to simulate cryptographic obfuscation.

- 🔒 **Inversion Resistance**:  
  Makes it difficult for adversaries to recover the original data directly from the latent space.

- 🛠 **Robust Decoder Reconstruction**:  
  The decoder is trained to handle noisy or encrypted latent vectors and still output accurate reconstructions.

- 📈 **Visualization**:  
  Includes plots for reconstruction quality, latent vector clusters, and loss tracking.

## 🧠 Concept Overview

Traditional autoencoders compress data into a latent space which, if accessed, can be used to reconstruct the original input. This poses a privacy risk. Our approach introduces cryptographic elements in the encoding process, making the latent representations:

- Less interpretable without the decoder
- Non-invertible via simple mathematical means
- Still useful for downstream secure reconstructions
